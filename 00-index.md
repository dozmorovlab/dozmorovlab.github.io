Welcome
--------

We are a bioinformatics and computational biology group in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://biostatistics.vcu.edu/) at Virginia Commonwealth University. We are interested in developing statistical methods and bioinformatics tools for the integrative analysis of genomic datasets generated by sequencing technologies. Our expertise includes Cancer and Immunology research. Through collaborations, we analyze high-throughput sequencing data, including single-cell sequencing, ChIP-seq, DNA methylation, ATAC-seq, whole-exome sequencing, and perform custom genomics analyses, such as ancestry profiling from RNA-seq data. We are a part of the PDXNet network supported by the U54 U4HELPP award. We are interested in the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the human genome, develop [biostatistics methods and R packages](./software) for the analysis of chromatin conformation capture data, such as (single-cell) Hi-C. We are interested in AI/machine learning methods to maximize biological understanding of genomics data.
